Reflection essay:
When we first started working on this lab, we first created a basic helloworld project and created a hello_world app inside it. But even this task was very difficult. The slides uploaded on piazza were very brief and we were unable to understand how to start. The online tutorial had different instructions than the slides and we were confused about what to follow. Then we decided to follow the tutorial and made our first basic hello_world app. We first made changes in the hello_world/views.py file and added the message of Hello, world. Then we created the hello_world/urls.py file and added the url response of calling the views.index. Then we made changes to the helloworld/urls.py file and added the url of calling hello_world app. We were facing problem in compilation error but we then noticed that we had not imported the include function that we were using to call the hello_world app.
Then our basic app (task 0) was finished.
We had already created a team on bitbucket and we committed our work till then and pushed onto bitbucket. But on committing, a strange thing happened. We were working on laptop of Rishank, with Ajinkya logged into bitbucket and on pushing we saw the author to be Satvat. When we later saw how to see the configured user name and email id, then we understood that the cause was that the configured user name and email were of Satvat. So, we made changes using git config and changed them into user name and email of Rishank.
The next part came out to be very tough. We had no idea what models were. Nor were we able to understand from the tutorials. But later we started on what little we could think of like a model for admin, a model for instructor and a model for courses.
